# Exploding-Box-Game
A basic gravity simulation. The boxes keep falling until they hit another stationary box (and stop), collide and combine with an obstacle (which then explodes and destroys all boxes in a 3-by-3 area), or reach the bottom of the board.

This is just a pet project. I might add a GUI later if possible (not quite experienced with that). Feel free to suggest any changes.
